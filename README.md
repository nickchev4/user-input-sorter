**Overview:**

This repository is a set of java classes. I have used intelliJ IDEA to execute the code. The program takes a list of integers depending on user input, stores them in an unsorted array, and gives examples of their newly sorted contents in ascending order using three simple sorting algorithms.

**How is this Applicable?**

I have not created this program for commercial use. This is simply used to demonstrate my knowledge of sorting algorithms. This is applicable in data management and analysis, since sorting raw data is essential to finding trends. Knowing how to implement data from the user and sort it efficiently is an essential skill in the field.

**Runtimes:**

The algorithms I have implemented are Merge Sort (O n log n), Bubble Sort (On^2), and Insertion Sort (O n^2).

**Testing**

All classes have been tested using JUnit 4.
